      "description": "Led the evolution of a comprehensive corporate banking platform serving enterprise clients with multi-currency accounts, complex payment workflows, loans, and reporting. Achieved 80% reduction in time-to-market while scaling the team and maintaining exceptional code quality.",
      "markdownDescription": "## Project Overview\n\nAs Technical Lead for the Bankerise Corporate Banking Platform, I spearheaded evolution of a mission-critical system enabling enterprises to manage multi-currency accounts, domestic/international payments, trade finance, and comprehensive reporting through a unified interface. The platform addresses the core challenge of processing high-value transactions with complex approval hierarchies while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.\n\nBuilt on Domain-Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture, the system handles millions of dollars in daily transaction volume across multiple markets. **Business Impact:** Reduced client implementation from 8-12 months to 2-3 months (80% reduction), enabling 4x faster onboarding while maintaining quality standards.\n\n<!-- DIAGRAM_PLACEHOLDER: Corporate Banking System Architecture - Hexagonal architecture layers, aggregate boundaries, Sopra integration adapters, CQRS event flow -->\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nArchitected using Domain-Driven Design with Hexagonal Architecture, separating bounded contexts for Payments, Accounts, Loans, Trade Finance, and Reporting. Domain aggregates enforce business rules with event-driven cross-aggregate communication. Integrated with Sopra Banking Platform and proprietary systems via adapter layer, abstracting SOAP/REST complexities while enabling vendor switching. Implemented CQRS for complex queries and event sourcing for audit trails. Database migrations managed via Liquibase for zero-downtime deployments.\n\n## Key Responsibilities\n\n- **Architectural Design**: Designed and maintained hexagonal architecture with clear domain/application/infrastructure boundaries\n- **Domain Modeling**: Led modeling sessions to capture complex banking workflows as rich domain models with proper aggregate boundaries\n- **Performance Optimization**: Refactored transaction processing, reducing payment approval from 3.5s to 800ms through query optimization\n- **Workflow Engine**: Designed flexible multi-level approval system supporting complex business rules (amount thresholds, role hierarchies, dual authorization)\n- **Integration Layer**: Architected Sopra Banking Platform adapter layer, abstracting API complexities from domain logic\n- **Quality Leadership**: Established 80% code coverage with ArchUnit enforcement, preventing architectural violations\n- **Team Mentorship**: Scaled team from 5 to 10 engineers while transitioning to architect role, maintaining code quality through reviews and pair programming\n- **Feature Delivery**: Implemented payment initiation, account management, loan origination, and regulatory reporting modules\n\n## Key Achievements & Impact\n\n- **80% Time-to-Market Reduction**: Transformed implementation from 8-12 months to 2-3 months through modular architecture and configuration-driven customization\n- **Team Scaling**: Grew development team from 5 to 10 engineers while maintaining 80% code coverage and zero architectural violations\n- **Rapid Release Cadence**: Delivered 1-2 releases every 3-week sprint to 3 parallel integration teams\n- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Enabled production deployments without service interruption\n- **Architectural Excellence**: Automated architecture validation with ArchUnit in CI/CD pipeline\n\n## Technical Highlights\n\n### Domain Event System\nDesigned elegant event system for cross-aggregate communication with events published within transaction boundaries, asynchronous handlers for eventual consistency, and event replay capability for debugging and audit.\n\n<!-- CODE_PLACEHOLDER: PaymentInitiatedEvent publishing from Payment aggregate and handling in Notification context -->\n\n### Configuration-Driven Customization\nBuilt flexible configuration engine enabling client-specific customization without code changes: approval workflow rules, fee calculation formulas, UI field visibility, and multi-tenant data isolation.\n\n### Performance Engineering\nOptimized critical paths: payment approval from 3.5s to 800ms, HikariCP connection pooling, strategic caching for reference data (exchange rates, fees), and batch processing for bulk operations.\n\n## Challenges & Solutions\n\n**Challenge**: Approval workflows required code changes per client's policies.\n\n**Solution**: Designed flexible rule engine using Specification Pattern with state machine for transitions. Business rules defined declaratively in configuration, enabling non-technical users to customize flows.\n\n**Impact**: Reduced customization from 2-3 weeks development to 2-3 hours configuration per client.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge**: Each client uses different core banking systems (Sopra, proprietary) with varying protocols (SOAP/REST) and data formats.\n\n**Solution**: Implemented Hexagonal Architecture adapter pattern with Banking API Port. Created system-specific adapters handling protocol differences and Anti-Corruption Layer for model translation.\n\n**Impact**: Onboarded 3 core banking systems without domain logic changes. Reduced integration time from 3 months to 3 weeks per system.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge**: Team growth (5 to 10 developers) risked architectural consistency and code quality.\n\n**Solution**: Automated governance with ArchUnit in CI/CD, comprehensive onboarding with Architecture Decision Records, mandatory reviews with architecture checklist, and weekly guild meetings.\n\n**Impact**: Maintained 80% coverage and zero violations despite 100% team growth.\n\n## Team & Collaboration\n\nLed cross-functional team of 10 engineers (6 backend, 2 frontend, 2 QA) organized around bounded contexts in Agile/Scrum with 3-week sprints. Established rigorous code review culture focused on domain modeling and architectural alignment. Organized weekly technical sessions on DDD concepts and design patterns.

      "markdownDescription": "## Project Overview\n\nAs Backend Developer for Insurise® platform, I built an innovative omnichannel digital insurance solution transforming customer interactions for 3 major insurance clients (BH Assurance, Comar, Star Assurance) in Tunisia. The platform revolutionized the industry by enabling digital quotes, policy purchases, claims management, and portfolio tracking through seamless channels. Serving 20,000+ users with 1,000-2,000 daily active users, it handles auto, home, professional liability, and travel insurance with real-time quote generation and digital claims processing. **Business Impact**: Reduced policy issuance from 5-7 days to instant digital issuance. Transformed claims processing from 15-30 days to 3-5 days.\n\n<!-- DIAGRAM_PLACEHOLDER: Insurise Platform Architecture - Microservices, API gateway, MongoDB documents, PostgreSQL transactions, Redis caching, omnichannel access -->\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nBuilt modular backend with domain-driven services for quotes, subscriptions, claims, payments, and customer management. Dual database strategy: PostgreSQL for transactional insurance data, MongoDB for document storage. Redis caches high-frequency data (rate cards, configurations). Elasticsearch powers customer, policy, and claims search. Integrated with payment gateways, SMS/email providers, and third-party rating engines via RESTful APIs.\n\n## Key Responsibilities\n\n- **Platform Development**: Built core infrastructure including quote engine, subscription management, claims processing, and payment workflows\n- **Omnichannel API Layer**: Designed APIs supporting web, mobile, and agent portals with consistent experience\n- **Quote Engine**: Implemented real-time rating engine calculating premiums based on risk factors, coverage options, and client-specific pricing rules\n- **Claims Workflow**: Developed end-to-end process (submission, document upload, adjuster assignment, approval chains, settlement)\n- **Payment Integration**: Connected multiple gateways (Paymee, ClickToPay) for subscriptions, renewals, and installments\n- **Database Design**: Architected hybrid schema optimizing ACID transactions (PostgreSQL) and flexible documents (MongoDB)\n- **Client POCs**: Prepared and presented Proof of Concepts demonstrating platform capabilities to potential clients\n\n## Key Achievements & Impact\n\n- **20K+ Users**: Scaled to 20,000+ users with 1,000-2,000 daily actives maintaining <2s response times\n- **3 Major Clients**: Delivered customized solutions to BH Assurance, Comar, and Star Assurance\n- **Multi-Insurance Engine**: Implemented flexible product engine supporting 4 insurance types with unique rating rules\n- **95% Time Reduction**: Reduced policy issuance from days to minutes through automation\n- **Omnichannel Consistency**: Enabled seamless experience across web, mobile, and agent channels\n\n## Technical Highlights\n\n### Quote Engine with Rule System\nBuilt sophisticated rating engine with risk assessment based on customer profile and coverage selection, configurable pricing rules per product and client, real-time premium calculation with tax/fee application, and multi-currency support.\n\n<!-- CODE_PLACEHOLDER: Quote Engine Service - risk calculation, pricing rule evaluation, premium computation with builder pattern -->\n\n### Claims Processing Workflow\nComprehensive 6-step digital system: Submission (incident details, documentation) → Validation (policy coverage, eligibility) → Assignment (intelligent adjuster allocation) → Assessment (photo upload, expert review) → Approval (multi-level workflow) → Settlement (payment, policy adjustment).\n\n### Optimized Data Storage\nPostgreSQL for structured transactions (policies, customers, payments), MongoDB for flexible documents (PDFs, claim photos, contracts), Redis for high-frequency cache (rate cards, configs, sessions), Elasticsearch for fast search index.\n\n## Challenges & Solutions\n\n**Challenge**: Each insurance type (auto, home, travel, professional) has unique rating factors, coverage options, and regulatory requirements.\n\n**Solution**: Designed flexible product engine with configurable rating rules, coverage templates, and validation schemas. Used Strategy Pattern for type-specific logic. Externalized business rules to configuration.\n\n**Impact**: Onboarded 4 insurance types in 18 months without architectural changes. Enabled product launches in weeks vs months.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge**: Premium calculation involved complex risk assessment, pricing rules, discounts, and taxes—potentially slow.\n\n**Solution**: Implemented multi-layer Redis caching for rate cards and configurations. Optimized pricing engine with lazy evaluation. Pre-computed common risk profiles. Added async calculation for complex scenarios.\n\n**Impact**: <800ms response time for 95% of quotes. 70% reduction in database queries.\n\n## Team & Collaboration\n\n10-member product team (7 backend, 2 frontend, 1 QA) in Agile with 2-week sprints, daily standups, retrospectives, and sprint demos. Collaborated with insurance business analysts, UX designers, and QA engineers. Organized technical sessions on microservices and platform architecture.\n\n<!-- SCREENSHOT_PLACEHOLDER: Insurise customer portal - policy dashboard, real-time quote generation, claims submission, payment history -->",
